I recently bought a domain. Not for the first time, but this is my first purchase for personal use. Throughout my studies and other developer related work I have always had a lot of supporting infrastructure. Colleagues who have already set up deployment pipelines, where all I had to to was push something to a git repository. Not that this is an issue, but at the end of the day I sit with the feeling that my hand needs to be held if I want to do anything on the web, or any other software project for that matter.

I intend for that to change. And where else to start, than buying a domain. But now what? This domain needs to lead somewhere, and what should I be hosting? Writing is a skill I have always admired from afar. A poorly honed skill, which is less than ideal. I tend to write as if I am having a real life conversation, which makes sense in my head, but rarely on paper.
