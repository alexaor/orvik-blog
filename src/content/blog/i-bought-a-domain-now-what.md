I recently bought a domain. Not for the first time, but this is my first purchase for personal use. Throughout my studies and other developer related work I have always had a lot of supporting infrastructure. Colleagues who have already set up deployment pipelines, where all I had to to was push something to a git repository. Not that this is an issue, but at the end of the day I sit with the feeling that my hand needs to be held if I want to do anything on the web, or any other software project for that matter.

I intend for that to change. And where else to start, than buying a domain. But now what? This domain needs to lead somewhere, and what should I be hosting? Writing is a skill I have always admired from afar. A poorly honed skill, which is less than ideal. I tend to write as if I am having a real life conversation, which makes sense in my head, but rarely on paper.

This is starting out as a basic astro blog template, deployed using cloudflare. Not without issues however.

After some extensive googling I had my suspicion the problem either being the node version, or the packages being used. I started with getting rid of MDX, which didn't really change anything. The only thing that actually worked was replacing yarn with npm as my package manager, which is by no means an obvious solution. No one seems to have a similar problem either.

Bless.
